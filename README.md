## Drum Kit 🥁
This project is based on the different sounds produced when instruments of Drum Kit are hit.
Drum kit is a beginner friendly project that allows you to play drums on the browser.

It has a number of keys on the webpage representing different drums in a typical drum set.

When you click on any of the keys, you’ll get the corresponding sound of the drum. And you can press them as many times as you want.
